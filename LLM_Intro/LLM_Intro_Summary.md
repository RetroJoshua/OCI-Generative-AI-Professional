# Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) - Summary

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Introductory, accessible overview of large language models (LLMs)
- **Scope**: Slightly deeper technical depth than mainstream media coverage
- **Target Audience**: Anyone, regardless of background

## What is a Language Model?

### Core Definition
- **Probabilistic models of text** that compute distributions over vocabulary
- Given a text prefix (e.g., "I went to the zoo to send me a pet. They sent me a--"), the model outputs probability scores for each word in its vocabulary

### Key Characteristics
- Only assigns probabilities to words within its **known vocabulary**
- Returns probability distribution for **every word** in vocabulary, but nothing outside it
- Processes sequences of words to generate these probability distributions

## Understanding "Large" in LLMs

### What "Large" Means
- Refers to the **number of parameters** in the model
- **No universal threshold** exists for what constitutes "large" vs. "not large"
- Term is somewhat **meaningless** without context

### Practical Usage
- Often refers to models used for **text generation**
- Term applied loosely (even to smaller models like BERT that some wouldn't consider "large")
- More about the **style of language model** than actual size

## Core Questions Driving This Module

1. **Can we influence the model's output distribution?**
   - How do we affect the probability numbers assigned to each word?

2. **What mechanisms change token probabilities?**
   - What tools do we have to modify these distributions?

3. **How do we generate text from distributions?**
   - How do we move from probability scores to actual text output?

## Module Structure - Three Main Technical Areas

### 1. Architecture
- **How models are built** - internal structure and design
- **What they look like under the hood**
- **Implications of architecture** on model capabilities and intended behavior

### 2. Influencing the Distribution
Two primary methods to affect LLM output:

#### Prompting
- **Does NOT change** model parameters
- Method to guide model behavior without modification

#### Training
- **Does change** model parameters
- Fundamental modification of the model itself

### 3. Decoding
- **Technical term** for generating text from an LLM
- **Process**: Using vocabulary distributions to create sentences, paragraphs, documents
- Multiple techniques and strategies for text generation

## Extensions and Future Applications

### Research Applications
- **Academic research community** innovations
- **Industrial research** developments
- **Novel extensions** of the three core concepts (architecture, training/prompting, decoding)

### Advanced Topics
- New and interesting ways these foundational ideas are being applied
- Cutting-edge developments in the field

## Learning Path
1. **Foundation**: Understanding what LLMs are and core concepts
2. **Deep Dive**: Architecture → Influencing Distributions → Decoding
3. **Advanced**: Extensions and real-world applications
